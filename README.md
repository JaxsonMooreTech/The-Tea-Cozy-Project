# The-Tea-Cozy-Project
HTML and CSS files for Tea Cozy project done in CodeAcademy code editor. 
Hello! This is a project I recently completed on the CodeAcademy code editor. The project came with an outline for specifics and the rest are what I could learn from others that ventured to try this project. 
Please let me know of any mistakes you may find! Or any notes that would improve my styling and coding skills! 
Thank you for viewing my page!
